#### 06-AJAX Assignment

The website adds buttons with a value the user defines. Upon clicking the button an AJAX is called to create 10 tabs with relevant gifs from Gify. The tabs can be selected and added to a favorites array which can be called later. If the favorites array is active the same button can be pressed to remove the gifs from the favorites array.
